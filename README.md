### Overview
This project is written from the perspective of the world's most traveled cat, Scott. He is not just a cat but a peacemaker cat. Bebeur (see Louis-Ferdinand Céline) at the end of 2022. In the countries that endure his presence, he brings bitterness, depression, and the dove of peace. Scott has already traveled from St. Petersburg to Moscow, Rostov, and Krasnodar. He crossed the Black Sea on an Intex inflatable mattress, traveled from Istanbul to Smyrna, boarded a ferry to Lesbos, where he has decided to stay for a couple of weeks. Praise be to Allah, cats are loved on the Aegean islands (see the legend of the cat Muizza).

### Technologies Used

HTML (incl. Grid and Adaptive Layout), CSS, JavaScript
GitHub
GitHub Pages
VS Code as the IDE
API
and finally WebPack!
Images

All images were supposed to be optimized with Squoosh: both Scott and I like it very much. However, it turned out that WebPack optimizes images even better.

### Thoughts

Scott is worried that if his owner makes one wrong move in Git, everything will collapse. And the owner will likely not be able to restore everything from memory. If it can be restored at all.
